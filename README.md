# Welcome to Girl Scouts Troop 03090

Thank you so much for showing interest in our Girl Scout troop!
Girl Scouts empowers young girls with essential life skills, from leadership and entrepreneurship to community service and global awareness. Through diverse activities in a supportive environment, members build character, forge lifelong friendships, and prepare for future challenges and opportunities. To learn more about what we will be doing, please visit https://www.girlscouts.org

## Logistics
- We’ll meet every other Wednesday starting on October 4, 2023
- Meetings will be from 4:45pm-6pm
- Meetings will be held in the library at PS110

## Scouting and Affordability

We believe every girl should have the opportunity to be a part of our troop, regardless of financial circumstances. 

Here are some considerations for your commitment:

- There is a $25 registration fee for the US Girl Scout organization. If this poses a challenge, there's an option to select financial aid during the sign-up process.

- Our troop will be sponsored by the organization as an Access Troop, which provides members with the basics each girl needs to begin their journey: a Brownie sash, troop insignia, and a few basic badges for our first year. 

- To cover the costs of our troop meetings, including snacks, supplies, and more advanced badges, we will be asking for a suggested donation of $100- however, we urge you to contribute whatever is feasible for your situation.

- Additional costs may arise throughout the year for events and field trips which can be optional.

- As this is our troop’s first year, we do not have any prior funds from previous cookie sales. We hope to participate this year.
 
## What we need from you
If there is anything specific about your daughter that you think we should be aware of, whether it's medical, behavioral, or personal preferences, do let us know. We aim to provide a safe and nurturing environment for all our scouts. 

We are looking for volunteers to support meetings and outings. Please let us know if you are available and we will send you more information on formally registering as a volunteer with the troop.

Lastly, we'll require a few forms to be completed before our first troop meeting on October 4th.
